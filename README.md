# rock-paper-scissors-game

Rock Paper Scissors Game code that allows user to input rounds and keeps round and total score.

This is a basic Python Code for the game with functionalities like:

-> Allows user to input the number of rounds.

-> At the end, asks user if he wants to continue.

The code uses the RPS class in Python to store placeholders for each of rock, paper, and scissors on top of each other, and then uses a while loop to prompt the player for their choice.

After the player makes their choice, it is compared to the computer's choice (which is generated during each game using the random.choice function) to determine who won.

Afterward, the user is offered the option to continue playing or quit the game.

The code uses several Python functions and features, such as the system module, the random choice module, and the enum class.
